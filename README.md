A game similar to Cookie Clicker, where you have to click on the screen to receive money to be able to buy improvements that can automatically generate income or multiply the rate obtained per click.

**This is a fully development version, there will be a lot of bugs and performance issues.**

* Assets used from Stardew Valley itself to streamline the development part.
* Game developed entirely at IDLE using pygame, pathlib and time libraries.
  
> Note: Project developed in the Introduction to Computing for Automation classes
